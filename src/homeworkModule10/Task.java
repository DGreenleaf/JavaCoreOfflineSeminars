    ЗАДАНИЕ 1

    Create a class with a main( ) that throws an object of class Exception inside a try block.
    Give the constructor for Exception a String argument.
    Catch the exception inside a catch clause and print the String argument.
    Add a finally clause and print a message to prove you were there.

    ЗАДАНИЕ 2

    Create your own exception class using the extends keyword.
    Write a constructor for this class that takes a String argument and stores
    it inside the object with a String reference.
    Write a method that prints out the stored String.
    Create a try-catch clause to exercise your new exception.

            ЗАДАНИЕ 3

    Define an object reference and initialize it to null.
    Try to call a method through this reference.
    Now wrap the code in a try-catch clause to catch the exception.

    ЗАДАНИЕ 4

    Create a class with two methods, f( ) and g( ).
    In g( ), throw an exception of a new type that you define.
    In f( ), call g( ), catch its exception and, in the catch clause,
    throw a different exception (of a second type that you define).
    Test your code in main( ).

    ЗАДАНИЕ 5

    Create three new types of exceptions.
    Write a class with a method that throws all three.
    In main( ), call the method but only use a single catch clause that will catch all three types of exceptions.
